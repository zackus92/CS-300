# CS-300

Working with C++ and data structures, the main problem that needed to be solved was data management and how to select a proper way to handle different amounts of data. This entailed using different data structures to find the most efficient one for the task at hand. Working with each method gave me a firsthand look at the strengths and weaknesses of different structures. As I was doing the project, I realized that I could use map, which auto sorts the data by course number. I was able to simplify the program as much as I knew how to. It negated the need for me to create separate sorting functions, making the code easier to follow. Along with those benefits maps scalability is perfect for growing or shrinking data sets, it can easily manage deleting and inserting data all while quickly finding what the user is looking for. Without a deeper understanding of these systems, I could have made another structure work, but efficiency would have suffered. 

I’ve learned that choosing a data structure has to be carefully thought out.  It isn’t just about what I can implement but about what will best work for the project in terms of performance and maintainability. This has certainly changed how I approach designing software. Another aspect that I improved on was finding the simplest ways to solve problems. I know that in the future I won’t be designing programs for my eyes only, so clarity is something I have been working on throughout.
